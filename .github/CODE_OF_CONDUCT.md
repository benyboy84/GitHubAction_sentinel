# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Treat GitHub Community with respect. We are a shared resource — a place to share
skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation.

The following are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our
community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized
public discourse.

### Best Practices for Maintaining a Strong Community

* Engage with consideration and respect.

  * **Be welcoming and open-minded** - New users join our community each day. Some are
   well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas
   and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to
   new collaborators and those just getting started.
  * **Be respectful** - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may
   happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive
   criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage
   respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to
   deescalate a tense situation.
  * **Be empathetic** - GitHub is a global community with people from a wide variety
    of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put
    yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them.
    Do your best to help make GitHub a community where others feel safe to make
    contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.

* Contribute in a positive and constructive way.
  
  * **Improve the discussion**. Help us make this a great place for discussion by
    always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are
    not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and
    try again later.<br>
    
    The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter
    to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if
    you disagree with some of what is being said.<br>
    
  * **Be clear and stay on topic**. GitHub Community is for collaboration, sharing
    ideas, and helping each other get stuff done. Off-topic comments are a distraction
    (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive.
    Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.<br>

    This applies to sharing links, as well. Any links shared in GitHub Community
    discussions should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate
    information. Links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a
    site. Links should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and
    purpose of the link. Posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant
    and valuable context can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious
    purposes.<br>

  * **Share mindfully**. When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a
    project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context. Don't post
    links that don't add value to the discussion, and don't post unsolicited links to
    your own projects or sites on other user's threads.<br>

    Additionally, don't share sensitive information. This includes your own email address.
    We don't allow the sharing of such information in GitHub Community, as it can create
    security and privacy risks for the poster, as well as other users. If you'd like to
    invite other GitHub users to collaborate on a project or work with you, share a link
    to the repository in which the project you are working on exists. By sharing the link
    to your project repo - with some information on what your project is and what kind of
    help or feedback you're looking for - you can invite others to collaborate with you via
    issues or pull requests without having to share your private information. You can also
    add others as outside collaborators on your project repo to give them special permissions
    to help you develop your project.

  * **Keep it tidy**. Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend
    more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So:
    * Don’t start a discussion in the wrong category.
    * Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple discussions.
    * Don’t post no-content replies.
    * Don't "bump" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share.
    * Don’t divert a discussion by changing it midstream.

    Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the upvote button. Rather than taking an existing
    discussion in a radically different direction, open a new discussion.

* Be trustworthy.

  * **Always be honest**. Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead
    other GitHub Community participants. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question
    but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at {{ email }}. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
